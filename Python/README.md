# **The Python script provided in the SUMRAY code**
This is the Python-3 script to compute the attributable probability rates and the Cumulative Excess Risks (CERs) of all solid cancers from radiation exposures.

The scripts were written by the Research Group on the development of cancer risk estimation code associated with radiation exposure (FY2020 - FY2021) of Japan Health Physics Society (JHPS).

*Version 1.0. Released June 30, 2023.*

## Preparation
This script runs in the Python-3 runtime environment. In addition, the script requires the *os*, *sys*, *csv*, *pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, and *scipy* libraries. Before using this script, the users must install these libraries in their Python-3 runtime environment. Below is an example of installing the *pandas* library using the *pip* command.  
  
 ```sh
 pip install pandas
 ```  
  
## Usage
For instructions on how to use this script, please refer to the [PDF file](https://github.com/JapanHealthPhysicsSociety/SUMRAY/files/11660068/Python-Usage.pdf) or the supplement of the paper.
