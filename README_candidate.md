# **SUMRAY: The Radiation Risk Computing Code of JHPS**
This repository provides R and Python-3 scripts to compute the attributable probability rates and the Cumulative Excess Risks (CERs) of all solid cancers from radiation exposures.

These scripts were written by the Research Group on the development of cancer risk estimation code associated with radiation exposure (FY2020 - FY2021) of Japan Health Physics Society (JHPS).

*Version 1.0. Released June 30, 2023.*
